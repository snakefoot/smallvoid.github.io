Smallvoid.com is dedicated to the operating system Microsoft Windows and its experienced users. A wide range of [news sources](/about/rss-party/) are periodically scanned for articles about Microsoft Windows, and the information is filtered and categorized for future reference.  
  
 Smallvoid.com original name was "Home of Snakefoot" and during that period the website stayed at various free web hotels. This changed with the purchase of Smallvoid.com as an email-domain name, as it also included a webhotel, and now it has become a blog.  
  
 To give comments or ideas for how to improve Smallvoid.com then write an email to [sweaty1@hotmail.com](mailto:sweaty1@hotmail.com?subject=Comments%20for%20Smallvoid.com "Snakefoot").
