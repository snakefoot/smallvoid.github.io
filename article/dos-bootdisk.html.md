The DOS bootdisk allows you to startup a machine with no operating system installed (or a non-working operating system). It can be used to install a new operating system or repair the existing operating system. It can also be used when needing to upgrade firmware or BIOS ex. on the motherboard.  
  
 There are different utilities, which can be useful on a bootdisk:
