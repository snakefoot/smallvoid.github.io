Microsoft has never released a service pack for Windows 98 Second Edition. Even though Windows 98 SE has been one of the most widely used operating systems, then it has been left in the rubble by Microsoft.  
  
[98 SE Service Pack](http://exuberant.ms11.net/) is an unofficial servicepack, which is a combined collection of the different patches released by Microsoft.  
  
 When combined with [Maximus Decim Native USB](http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=43605) then Windows 98 suddenly becomes quite useful.
