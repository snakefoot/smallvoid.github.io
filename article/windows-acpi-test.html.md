Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is a specification that allows the operating system to monitor and manage the hardware configuration, power-usage and temperature. The system BIOS must support ACPI before the operating system will have proper control of the hardware.  
  
 Microsoft have developed an utility for testing the [ACPI](http://www.acpi.info/) compatibility of the system BIOS, which can be used diagnose hardware problems that might be caused by a faulty system BIOS.
