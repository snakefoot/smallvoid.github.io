[IIS Lockdown](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/locktool.mspx) is an utility that makes it easier secure your Internet Information Server (IIS) installation from being wide open for attacks. This is utility should be used on any Windows installation where IIS services like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, NNTP are being used.  
  
 Note the Lockdown Tool should be combined with the [URLScan](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx) tool if running IIS5 on Windows 2000 (Windows 2003 with IIS6 already includes the extra protection provided by URLScan).
