Windows 7 / 2008 introduces new wireless features that allows it to emulate a wireless hotspot, which other computers can connect to. This allows one to create a wireless network between two computers without actually needing a WIFI router.  
  
 There are different tools available that can activate this feature:

- [Connectify](http://www.connectify.me/)
- [Virtual Router](http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/) (Opensource)
