If Windows fails to install or just messes up the configuration of the installed hardware, then it can be a good idea to unplug/turn-off non-essential hardware like:

- USB devices
- Printer
- Soundcard (Disable if onboard)
- Network card (Disable if onboard)
- TV Tuner card
- Modem
- ...
 
 After succesfully installing Windows, then plug back in each hardware device one by one, and let Windows detect and install drivers for them.
