Microsoft created the utility Msconfig to monitor the [different locations](/article/win9x-startup-order.html), where programs can place themselves, so they are "hidden" and started automatically with Windows.

- [Download Msconfig](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=msconfig.zip)
 
 This Msconfig.exe comes from Windows 98 SE, and can be used without any trouble on Windows 95. Consider using [Startup CPL](/article/windows-startup-order.html#STARTUP_CPL) instead of Msconfig, as it is a lot better at showing the locations.
