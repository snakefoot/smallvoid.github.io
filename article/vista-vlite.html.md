[vLite](http://www.vlite.net/) allows one to add and remove windows components from the install image, so they are not included when actually deployed.
- Component removal
- Driver integration
- Unattended setup
- Split/merge Vista installation CDs
- Tweaks
- Bootable CD/DVD
 
 Note vLite requires that the .NET framework is installed.
