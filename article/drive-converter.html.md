[CVT](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=cvt.zip) is a command line tool which makes it possible to convert your FAT16 drive to FAT32.  
  
 Note this utility is automatically installed when installing the Drive Converter in Win98, Win98 SE, WinMe. If not wanting to install the whole Drive Converter thing then you can find the utility in the cab files at the install path. The CVT available here is from Windows 98 SE (US).
