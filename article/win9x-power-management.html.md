The Power Management Features in Windows 9x are not completely bug free, and many times they can introduce system instability or erratic cpu usage.  
  
 It is a generally good idea to disable power management features especially if using an ACPI compatible computer.

1. Press **Start** -&gt; **Settings** -&gt; **Control Panel** -&gt; **System-Device Manager** and expand **System devices**
2. Right click **Advanced Power Management support** and select **Properties**
3. Toggle **Disable in this hardware profile** for the device
 
 At the same time one should also disable the power management features in the motherboard BIOS, as long one is running Windows 9x.
