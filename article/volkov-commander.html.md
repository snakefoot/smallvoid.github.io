[Volkov Commander](http://egner-online.de/vc/ "Vsevolod V. Volkov") is a so called Norton Commander (NC) clone, which can be used as a File Manager. It is written entirely in assembler code, and it is free (only the alpha version), faster, smaller (only 70 KByte) and just as easy to use as Norton Commander. It is the perfect utiltity to place on a [DOS boot disk](/article/dos-bootdisk.html).  
  
 Note combined with [DOSLFN](/article/long-filename-backup.html) it should be possible to get long filename support in real dos.
