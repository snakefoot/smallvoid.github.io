[Boot Log Analyzer](http://www.vision4.dial.pipex.com/) (BLA) ([Mirror](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=bla123.zip)) can be used if having problems with slow booting. It can help troubleshoot what devices or drivers are causing trouble. Besides showing failing devices, then it can also show how long it take to initialize a certain device or driver.  
  
 Note before being able to use the tool to diagnose, then one first have to create a bootlog.txt (Press F8 when booting and it says "Starting Windows...").
