The cd key is stored as clear text in [Windows 9x](/article/win9x-cd-key.html) and [Windows NT4](/article/winnt-cd-key.html), but newer versions of Windows and Office encrypts the cd keys a little.  
  
 To help decrypting the cd keys, then one can use the following utilities:

- [Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder](http://www.magicaljellybean.com/) (Can also change the cd-key for Win9x,WinXP and Win2k3)
- [ProduKey](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html) (Can also retrieve the product key from another computer)
- [Windows Product Key Viewer](http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/utility/winproductkey/)
- [RockXP](http://www.rockxp.org/ "korben.tk") (Win2k/XP only, can change the XP key)
- [Bob's XP-Keyview](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=xpsp1.zip) (XP only)
- [ViewKeyXP](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=viewkeyxp.zip) (XP only, doesn't support SP2)
