[Advanced Security for Outlook](http://www.mapilab.com/outlook/security/) can be useful to diagnose and configure addons in Outlook 2000, 2002 (XP), 2003. By default Outlook can show a popup (Allow Access for 1 Minute), when 3rd party addons are trying to use the different Outlook components. The popup can be useful for blocking malicious addon from trying to use Outlook for sending out spam and virus.  
  
 Sadly enough the popup doesn't display the name of the addon, so it is hard to decide whether it is good or bad addon. This utility can tell you the name of the addon and let you decide what to allow.
