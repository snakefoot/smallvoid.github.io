Some websites are testing that the web-browser used to access the website has the correct version. This can be annoying when using IE7 and the website will only serve pages to Internet Explorer 6.0.  
  
[User Agent String Utility](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9517DB9C-3C0D-47FE-BD04-FAD82A9AAC9F) has been created by Microsoft, and makes it possible to get Internet Explorer 7.0 to say it is Internet Explorer 6. This can be used to get access to the browser restricted websites.  
  
 Your browser is currently giving the following user agent string:

> <script type="text/javascript">\<!--
> document.write(navigator.userAgent);
> \--></script>
