[Media Player 8 Rip](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=mp8_eng.zip "Media Player 8.0 build 4477 for Win2K - by Firecat") makes it possible to install Windows Media Player (WMP) 8 on Windows 2000.  
  
**\*WARNING\*** This install will try to disable [Windows File Protection (WFP)](/article/winnt-wfp.html), because it has to overwrite system files which WFP otherwise would restore.
