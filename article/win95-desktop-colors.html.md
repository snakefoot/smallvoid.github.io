Windows 95 Plus! pack includes the ability to enable "Show icons using all possible colors". This makes the icons on the desktop much prettier as they are painted with more colors.  
  
 This feature is already included in Windows 95, and can be activated without installing the Plus! pack:

> \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER \\Control Panel \\Desktop \\WindowMetrics\]  
>  Shell Icon BPP = "16" (Default = 4)

 <table border="1"><tr><th>Setting</th><th>Colors</th></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>65,536</td></tr></table>
