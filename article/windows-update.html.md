Microsoft is not only famous for making software, Microsoft is also famous for making a lot of patches and updates. There are different types of updates:

- **Security/Critical Updates**: These updates are important and should be applied as quickly as possible. The updates usually closes holes that could allow unauthorized people to get access to your computer.
- **BugFix Updates**: These updates are made for correcting some of the strange behavior Windows has. They are usually only released to the public through Service Packs.
- **Recommended Updates**: These updates usually add new features to the existing components or add completely new components. They are usually followed by some Security- and BugFix-Updates.
 
 Microsoft has made it easy to keep Windows updated by using their Internet service [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). If not connected to the Internet, then one have to use another computer to download the updates and then copy them to the disconnected computer.  
  
 Microsoft Windows is a very complicated piece of software, and since the expense of finding all bugs before a release is quite high (and quite impossible), then Microsoft (and other software companies) releases their software when it is functional even though it has known bugs.
