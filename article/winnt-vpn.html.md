Virtual Private Network(VPN) allows you to create a protected/encrypted network between two machines using a tunnel, so other machines are not able to access this network. The VPN is created by one machine running a VPN client that connects to the other machine that is running a VPN server ([RRAS](/article/winnt-services-remoteaccess.html)).
