[nLite](http://www.nliteos.com/) allows one to add and remove windows components from the install image, so they are not included when actually deployed.
- Service Pack Integration
- Component Removal
- Unattended Setup
- Driver Integration
- Hotfixes Integration
- Tweaks

 Note nLite requires that the .NET framework is installed.  
  
 Note [RyanVM's Windows XP Post-SP2 Update Pack](http://www.ryanvm.net/msfn/updatepack.html) can be used in nLite to include all fixes since the latest XP service pack
