Many times when working with files then one wants to copy the location of a file to the clipboard to use it in another location. This action can be simplied by extending the context menu with the option "Copy Path".  
  
 This can be done with one of the following utilities:

- [ClipPath](http://personal.vsnl.com/sureshms/utilities.html)
- [Ninotech Path Copy](http://home.worldonline.dk/ninotech/freeutil.htm)
 
 Note [Windows 95 Powertoys](/article/win95-power-toys.html) includes the extension "Send To X", with the option "Send to Clipboard", which copies the path of the file into the clipboard.  
  
 Note [Send To Toys](/article/winnt-sendto-toys.html) includes the options "Send to Clipboard", which will copy the path of the file/folder to the clipboard.  
  
 Note Windows Vista includes the option "Copy as Path", which is shown when right-clicking a file or folder, while holding down the SHIFT-key.
