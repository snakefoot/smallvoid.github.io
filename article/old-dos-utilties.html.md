Windows 95 didn't include all DOS utilties in the default installation. Instead they were placed on the Windows 95 CD, so one could install them after installing Windows 95.  
  
 Some of the more interesting utilities included in [Olddos.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/W95/EN-US/olddos.exe):

- **Undelete.exe** - Unerase files on FAT16 partitions ([Norton Unerase](/article/norton-unerase.html) supports FAT32).
- **Memmaker.exe** - Optimize [UMB](/article/upper-memory-block-umb.html) and free conventional memory (QEMM is better).
- **Interlnk.exe** - Setup serial/parallel communication between two computers.
 
 Note the MS Backup utility has been placed in its own package [msback.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/bkup_b/1.0/W95/EN-US/msback.exe).
