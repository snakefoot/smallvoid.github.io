[Unlocker](http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/ "Cedrick 'nitch' Collomb") is an explorer extension that makes it possible to see/close other processes handles to a file. This allows one to delete/modify a file even if it is in use by another program (Though the other program might fail by such an action).
