There can be situations where your favorite CD / DVD have become scratched so badly, that no matter how many times you try to polish your favorite CD or DVD then it won't work. After having given up on getting all the data from the disc, then one will eagerly accept that most of the data is recovered.  
  
 The normal file copying tools are intended to perform fast, and fail at the first sign of trouble. This is where this different set of file copying tools takes over, they will retry the file copy and continue even if meeting a single bad sector.
