Windows Vista introduced [searching of the Start-menu](/article/winnt-start-menu-search.html) for easier navigation (Similar to QuickSilver for Mac OS X). This feature can also be added to older versions of Windows.

##### Launchy

 Desktop search engine that can be be activated with a keyboard-shortcut (ALT+Space). This allows one to quickly find the wanted item with a few keystrokes and launch it. One can specify which folders it should be searching (Start Menu, Favorite Bookmarks, Music, Movies, Source-code, etc.). More Info [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/ "Launchy: The Open Source Keystroke Launcher")
 
##### Find and Run Robot (FARR)

 Desktop search engine with heuristic ranking of results, which can be activated with your chosen hotkey. This allows one to quickly find the wanted item with a few keystrokes and launch it. One can specify which folders it should be searching (Start Menu, Favorite Bookmarks, Music, Movies, Source-code, etc.). Plug in support for integration with other applications. More Info [FARR](http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Mouser/findrun/index.html)
 
##### SlickRun

 Extended version of the standard Start Menu Run... option. It is possible to use Windows-key+R to launch SlickRun, but one is required to edit SlickRun.ini and set GrabWinR="1". More Info [Bayden Systems - SlickRun](http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/)
 
##### Speed Launch

 Creates a bull's-eye in the lower right corner of your primary monitor. When dragging files/application to the bull's-eye then you can assign them a keyword. You can then launch the file/application using the key-combination Win+C and entering the keyword.

##### Colibri

 Graphical command line with search capabilities, that can be activated by pressing CTRL+Space. This enables one to quickly find the wanted application in the Start-menu, but also be used to search the web. More Info [Colibri](http://colibri.leetspeak.org/)
 
#### Enso Launcher

 Desktop command line with search capabilities, that can be activated by pressing CAPS LOCK. The command line can be used to **open** new programs, or **go** to program already launched, etc. The memory footprint of this utility is quite large.
