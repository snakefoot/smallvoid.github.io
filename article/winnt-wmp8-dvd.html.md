[Media Player 8 - DVD Play](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=mp8_dvd.zip) enables you to play DVD (MPEG2 + AC3) in Media Player 8 (Actually CyberLink PowerDVD 3.0).  
  
 More Info [MS KB308012](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308012 "Resources for Troubleshooting DVD Problems in Windows XP [Q308012]")  
  
 Note it seems that setting this STRING value in the registry also can do the trick in WMP 6.4:
> \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER \\Software \\Microsoft \\MediaPlayer \\Player \\Settings\]  
>  EnableDVDUI = "Yes"
