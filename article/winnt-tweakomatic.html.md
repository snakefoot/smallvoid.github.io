[Tweakomatic](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=BD328D1E-6C01-4447-BD7C-C09646D722C8) is an utility that makes it easy to create scripts for retrieving and configuring the registry for computers using WMI. The utility has a predefined database of registry settings to retrieve or configure. The utility can be seen as complementary to [Group Policies](/article/winnt-group-policy-registry.html).
