People who like to multitask and have several applications opened at the same time, can experience that the standard Windows desktop and taskbar gets too over crowded. A solution to this problem is to create several virtual desktops, and then switch between the desktops depending on the task at hand.

- [Virtual Dimension](http://virt-dimension.sourceforge.net/) - Create several virtual desktops in Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000 and XP.
- [VirtuaWin](http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/) - Virtual Desktop Manager for Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000 and XP.
- [Yod'm 3D](http://www.chrisnsoft.com/yodm-3d/) ([Freeware Mirror](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=yodm3d.zip "Yodâ€™m 3D v1.4")) - Yet anOther Desktop Manager 3D for Windows XP and Vista (Was freeware but now taken over by Otaku Software and called Desk Space).
- [Vista/XP Virtual Desktop Manager](http://www.codeplex.com/vdm) - Uses the new Vista DWM interface to create multiple desktops (Also supports Windows XP).
- [Desktops 1.0](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx) - Creates virtual desktops by using the Windows Desktop object, with a separate Explorer instance for each desktop. This means the windows and shown / hidden correctly when switching between desktops, but cannot be moved between desktops and the tray icons will be difference on each desktop.
