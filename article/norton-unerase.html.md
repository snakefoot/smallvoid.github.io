[Norton Unerase](http://smallvoid.orgfree.com/?file=unerase.zip) allows one to recover deleted files from a FAT32 partition, where the standard [Undelete](/article/old-dos-utilties.html) can only handle FAT16 partitions.  
  
 Remember that one can only recover the file if the original location on the disk for the file is untouched. Therefore one should not copy or move files around after having discovered that a file was accidently deleted.
