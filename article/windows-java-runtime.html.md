Microsoft's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) contains several flaws, and with WinXP SP2 the JVM have been removed. If not using WinXP SP2 then one should consider to [remove the JVM manually](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/826878 "Availability of the Microsoft JVM Removal Tool [Q826878]") and replace it with the [Sun Java Runtine](http://java.com/en/download/download_the_latest.jsp). [Test Java Runtime Engine](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml).  
  
 Note Microsoft have withdrawn their removal tool for public download, instead one have to contact Microsoft to acquire the tool. [Majorgeeks.com](http://www.majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=4158) is friendly enough to provide a mirror of the tool.
