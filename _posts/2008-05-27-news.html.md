Microsoft have made Vista even more [stable with SP1](http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/005f921e-f706-401e-abb5-eec42ea0a03e1033.mspx) (though the major contributor is probably Vista ready drivers), and have at the same time given XP some love by collecting all patches released since SP2 into a single tested [SP3 package](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946480/).  
  
 Vista SP1 introduces a new [Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol](/article/winnt-services-sstpsvc.html) service, which allows VPN over SSL and makes it easier to setup VPN connections.  
  
 WinXP SP3 now also includes the [Network Access Protection Agent](/article/winnt-services-napagent.html), which makes it easier to protect the network against simple user mistakes, such as forgetting to apply security and antivirus updates. The [Wireless Zero Configuration](/article/winnt-services-wzcsvc.html) have been split into two, so now it only takes care of Wireless 802.1X authentication, while the new [Wired AutoConfig](/article/winnt-services-dot3svc.html) service takes care of wired connections.  
  
 Note [Firefox 3 RC1](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-rc.html) also seem ready for prime time ([besides the usual bug fixes](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9088858)). Been using FF3 the last few weeks and it has been very stable (Had to upgrade [my firefox addons](/article/firefox-favorite-addons.html) and the [Flash Player plugin](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/) manually). Really like the new [features in the address-bar](http://lifehacker.com/392160/top-10-firefox-3-features), but I miss the [persistent Go-button](http://nancib.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/regain-the-persistent-go-button-in-firefox-3/). Another new feature is the ability to duplicate a tab by holding down the CTRL-key while dragging the tab with the mouse (Would be nice with a right-click option).
