First post after upgrading to Wordpress 4.2 BETA3 (from ver. 2.0) with the following benefits:

- PHP Engine warnings about being deprecated are gone.
- Updated theme to use bootstrap, so it works better on mobile devices and Google will not give penalty.
 
 The old problem with taxonomy has not been fixed, but I found a way to fix it for this site.  
  
 Performance has gone down hill since Wordpress 2.0, so now a caching plugin is even more important:
- Old Version - FrontPage: 14 queries. 0.131 seconds
- New Version - FrontPage: 23 queries. 0.266 seconds
- Old Version - Single Post: 12 queries. 0.086 seconds
- New Version - Single Post: 29 queries. 0.326 seconds
 
 Please tell if something has been broken in the upgrade.
