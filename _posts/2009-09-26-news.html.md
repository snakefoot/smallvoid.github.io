Have now put up a [Windows 7 Service Guide](/articles/windows-7-win7/services-guide/), with a lot of help from the [BlackViper.com](http://www.blackviper.com/Windows_7/servicecfg.htm) website. It is pretty much the existing [Vista Service Guide](/articles/windows-vista/services/) with some extra services (19 services in total).  
  
 Also added two small Win7 tips:

- [Make sidebar and gadgets work with UAC disabled](/article/winnt-sidebar-uac.html). Credits [MyDigitalLife.info](http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/01/22/disable-uac-in-windows-7-with-sidebar-and-gadgets-working-properly/)
 
 Btw. if using AVG 8.5 and is tired of the nagging popup-offer about upgrading from the free version to the full version, then it can be removed with the following steps:
1. Go the install folder of AVG and browse to the **Notification** folder:
    > C:\\Program Files\\AVG\\AVG8\\Notification
2. Create a new sub-folder called **upgrade-oportunity-avg85**:
   > C:\\Program Files\\AVG\\AVG8\\Notification\\upgrade-oportunity-avg85
3. Move all files newer than the 1 July 2009 from the **Notification** folder to the **upgrade-oportunity-avg85** folder. This should include files like: 
  - style.css
  - upgrade-oportunity-avg85-message1.html
  - upgrade-oportunity-avg85-message2.html
  - upgrade-oportunity-avgavf85.gif
  - upgrade-oportunity-avgis85.gif
 
 I guess the market for low price antivirus packages will disappear, when Microsoft release their own free product [Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/) (Currently in beta stage).
