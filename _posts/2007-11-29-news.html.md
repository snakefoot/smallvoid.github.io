Windows Vista includes support of several new network features if they are available on the network interface card (also possible with Win2k3 SP2). One of the new features is the Receive-side Scaling (RSS), which actually solves the issue of [MMCSS needing to throttle network traffic](/article/news-2007-08-28.html), as it offloads the handling of interrupts and DPC to other CPU cores. Though one cannot use RSS if using [Internet Connection Sharing](/article/winnt-services-sharedaccess.html) (ICS).
