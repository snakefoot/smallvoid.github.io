Was looking at the possibility of mounting a FTP drive as a network drive, and found that there was several things in this area I didn't know.

- [Mapping FTP server as a network drive letter](/article/ftp-map-network-drive.html)
- [Mapping WebDAV folder as a network drive letter](/article/winnt-webdav-network-drive.html)
- [Adding FTP server / WebDAV folder as a network place](/article/winnt-web-network-place.html)
 
 Note if using a Gmail account, then one can use the [GMail Drive shell extension](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm) (Max 10 MByte files) to map it as a network drive, or use [RoamDrive](http://www.roamdrive.com/) (No file size limit). This is not officially supported by Google, so it will only work as long Google doesn't start blocking it.
