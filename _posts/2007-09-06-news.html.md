Yesterday this website was taken down because it was accused of hosting files, which violated copyright restrictions. The program that triggered this situation was [TweakNT](/article/winnt-upgrade-server.html), which allows one to change a Workstation-edition of Windows into a Server-edition.

> Dritte haben uns mitgeteilt, dass auf Ihrem Server http://smallvoid.com/tweak/winnt/files/tweaknt.zip unautorisiertes Angebot zum Download vorgehalten wird. In dem Angebot sind Dateien enthalten, welche die Urheberrechte Dritter verletzen.

 I was told by my host provider [Needhost.dk](http://needhost.dk) that I should remove all files (not just TweakNT) which could violate any copyrights. Since I like my host provider (cheap and good support), then I have decided to move all binary files to a different host. Hopefully this will keep the website from being closed down again in case of copyright charges.  
  
 Have added the following articles to celebrate the website being activated again: - [Vista Performance Tweak](/article/vista-file-copy-cached.html) about how to revert the file copying behavior to be like in the earlier versions of Windows.

- [Vista Network Tip](/article/vista-dhcp-client-broadcast.html) about how the DHCP client behavior have been changed to use broadcast, which [not all network routers support](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/02/1223209).
