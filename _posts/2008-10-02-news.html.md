Have spent the last few months writing a few articles for [CodeProject.com](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=2309141). During this time the collection of unpublished tips have been growing. Here is a few to start with:

- Added [Vista Tip](/article/winnt-uac-scheduled-task.html) about how to run programs elevated without UAC prompt. Credits [HowToGeek.com](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-administrator-mode-shortcuts-without-uac-prompts-in-windows-vista/)
- Added [Vista Tip](/article/winnt-oem-welcome-center.html) about how to change the OEM branding of the Welcome Center. Credits [Unlock for Us](http://unlockforus.blogspot.com/2008/01/branding-your-windows-vista-computer.html)
- Added [Vista SP1 Tip](/article/winnt-search-context-menu.html) about how to restore the search context menu option. Credits [VistaX64.com](http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/134065-search-context-menu-item-restore-after-vista-sp1.html)
- Added [Vista Tip](/article/ie-http-rwin-tuning.html) about how to enable auto-tuning of the RWIN in Internet Explorer
 
 Have also been playing around with Wordpress to add support for [HTTP 304 return code](http://rakaz.nl/item/reducing_the_bandwidth_used_by_feeds) when using [wp-cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache/). After enabling the support, then this blog returned 3 times as many 304 responses, though the bandwidth usage is pretty much the same according to the website statistics.
