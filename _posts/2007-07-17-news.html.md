The initial list of [Windows Vista services](/articles/windows-vista/services/) is now ready. Have been borrowing a lot from the following places:

- [ITsVista.com](http://itsvista.com/topic/services/) - Good description of the services beyond the one-liner from Microsoft, but doesn't have description for all the services yet.
- [BlackViper.com](http://www.blackviper.com/WinVista/servicecfg.htm) - Complete list of all services with serveral configuration recommendations, but not much description of why.
 
 The only services that I have found that one could consider to disable is all the services used for the Windows Media Center (Only installed with Home Premium and Ultimate). But I have feeling that in the near future when most people want to stream music and movies from the Internet to their television, then these services have to be activated anyway.
