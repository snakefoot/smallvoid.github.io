Created a new website [SnakeNest.com](http://snakenest.com/), where I'm planning to release the different small projects I'm working on.  
  
 Have now released the tail utility [SnakeTail](http://snakenest.com/snaketail/), that is also able to tail Windows EventLogs. No administrator rights are needed and it has faster startup than the standard Windows EventLog Viewer.
