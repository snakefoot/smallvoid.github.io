Have now configured a [news feed](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=bOrdrnsx3BGWd7xt6kjTQA) which is a mashup of different news sources about Microsoft Windows. It is now much easier to follow multiple news sites without needing to shovel through advertisements.

- Added [Ext2 / Ext3 file system driver](/article/winnt-linux-partition.html) to [Windows Utilities](/articles/windows-xp/utilities/).
- Added [Changing the font of the command prompt](/article/winnt-cmd-add-font.html) to [Command Prompt Tips](/articles/windows-xp/command-prompt/). Credits [Duffblog](http://www.orablogs.com/duffblog/archives/001209.html).
- Added [Perform clean install using Windows Vista upgrade](/article/vista-upgrade-install.html) to [Vista Install Tips](/articles/windows-vista/troubleshoot/). Credits [WindowsITPro.com](http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/95011/95011.html)
 
 Note a flaw has also been discovered in the [Multimedia Class Scheduler service](/article/winnt-services-mmcss.html) (MMCSS), which causes it to throttle the network speed unnecessary especially when using 1 Gigabit network and playing music. It becomes even worse if having several network adapters installed. Until a patch is released the solution to the network slow down seems to be disabling the service if affected by this bug.
