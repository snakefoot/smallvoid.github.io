First post after replacing WordPress with Jekyll static pages.

Became tired of WordPress constantly getting hacked, and for every new feature in WordPress then another backdoor was introduced.

It was surprisingly simple to convert WordPress into markdown, but have ofcouse lost all the dynamic features of WordPress.

Right now the focus is to ensure all pages are readable after the conversion without broken links.

Later I will have to look into restoring the categories and tags.
