Have now upgraded the [bbPress forum to ver. 0.83](http://bbpress.org/blog/2007/09/bbpress-083/), eventhough it is marked as an update to be compatible with Wordpress 2.3 then it still works fine with WP 2.0.  
  
 Have also modified the Wordpress blog search, so now it displays the categories which contains matching posts (This is also used when showing posts with a certain tag). Instead of showing the categories at the top of the search result, then I'm considering to move the relevant category listing into the sidebar.
