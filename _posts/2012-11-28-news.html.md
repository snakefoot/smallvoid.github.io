My web hotel ([Unoeuro.com](http://www.unoeuro.com/)) announced that they wanted to upgrade the PHP version from 5.2 to 5.3. This has caused some disturbances on this site, as Wordpress 2.0 is an aging blog engine and is not fully compatible with the "latest" PHP version.  
  
 Had to disable [E\_DEPRECATED in error\_reporting](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2803772/turn-off-deprecated-errors-php-5-3), as PHP 5.3 complains about function parameters passed by reference (&amp;). But besides some minor fixes in the Wordpress code (and plugins), then everything seems to be working again.  
  
 Still waiting for the [Ticket #5034](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5034) to be resolved, so I can upgrade to the latest version of Wordpress.  
  
 Also had my last work day at [Saxo Bank](http://cphpost.dk/news/saxo-bank-lay-off-266.3523.html), so it is now time to brush up my rusty [résumé](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rokris).
