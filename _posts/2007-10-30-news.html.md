Seems a lot of people like to save hard-disk space using NTFS compression, but accidently also compresses the boot manager files so it fails to boot.  
  
 Have added some articles about the Vista Boot Manager and system recovery:

- [Configuration of the boot manager entries](/article/winnt-bootmgr-config.html) which also includes two free utilities that are easier to use than BCDEdit.
- [Windows Recovery Environment](/article/winnt-recovery-environment.html) which replaces the Recovery Console known from Windows 2000/XP/2003.
- [Boot Manager is missing or compressed](/article/winnt-bootmgr-missing.html) which describes some solutions for these errors.
